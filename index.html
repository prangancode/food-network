                Weight Loss Secrets <br>
                From Food Network</h1>
            <p>The key to a healthy diet is to eat the right amount of calories for how active you are so you balancethe
                energy you consume with the energy you use.

                If you eat or drink more than your body needs, you'll put on weight because the energy you do not use
                isstored as fat. If you eat and drink too little, you'll lose weight.

                You should also eat a wide range of foods to make sure you're getting a balanced diet and your body is
                receiving all the nutrients it needs.</p>

            <h2>About Ella</h2>
            <p>Ella was a self-confessed ‘sugar monster’, whose snacks were far from the plant based goodness that she
                now promotes. But when she found herself bed-ridden more often than not, she decided to adopt a
                plant-based lifestyle overnight, and since then her good health has skyrocketed. With a cookbook out and
                a phone app, Deliciously Ella is a name that many of the health community already know of. Ella shares
                with us all her simple recipes, and the Deliciously Ella app provides easy to follow step by step
                cooking instructions that even the most domestically challenged of us can adhere to.</p>
