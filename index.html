                Weight Loss Secrets <br>
                From Food Network</h1>
            <p>The key to a healthy diet is to eat the right amount of calories for how active you are so you balancethe
                energy you consume with the energy you use.

                If you eat or drink more than your body needs, you'll put on weight because the energy you do not use
                isstored as fat. If you eat and drink too little, you'll lose weight.

                You should also eat a wide range of foods to make sure you're getting a balanced diet and your body is
                receiving all the nutrients it needs.</p>
